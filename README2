To build 1AND source code with FP feature, we need to use applypatch.sh to apply
the relevant patches first.

src : it contains the code directory for FP HAL/tac, FP TA, fpc-irq driver.
diff: it contains the necessary patches for FP feature which are not in HAL/TA/Driver directory.

The steps to use the script:
    1. mkdir AOSP_CODE
    2. repo init/sync
    3. In current directory, chmod and then run ./XXX/applypatch.sh
    4. source, lunch, make flashfiles to build the image
